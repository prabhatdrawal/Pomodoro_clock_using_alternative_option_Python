## Background
Computer graphics is the use of computers to create and display images and visuals. It includes drawing shapes, images, animations, and 3D models on a screen. Basic ele- ments of computer graphics involve pixels (the tiny dots that make up an image), colors (usually represented using the RGB color model), and coordinates to place objects. It
is used in games, movies, design, simulations, and user interfaces. Simple graphics include lines, circles, and rectangles, which are drawn using algorithms. Tools like
Pygame, OpenGL, and Unity help developers create graphics easily. Computer graph- ics make it possible to turn ideas into visual content using technology.
Pygame is a free and open-source Python library used for making 2D games and simple graphical applications. It provides modules for drawing shapes, handling images, play-
ing sounds, managing user input , and controlling the game loop. Pygame makes it easy to work with graphics by offering built-in functions to draw lines, circles, rectangles,
and display images on the screen. It is built on top of the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library, which handles low-level multimedia tasks. Pygame is popular among
beginners because it’s simple to use and works well for learning game development, animations, and basic computer graphics in Python. This project presents a responsive Pomodoro timer developed using Python and the Pygame library, designed to enhance focus and productivity through a combination of ambient animation and audio feedback. The timer operates in full-screen mode and dy- namically adapts to various screen resolutions by calculating UI element positions based on the device’s width and height, ensuring a consistent visual experience across dis- plays. Ambient background themes—such as campfires, snowy landscapes, and night- time cityscapes—are animated frame-by-frame and accompanied by looped audio, cre- ating an immersive and calming work environment. Motivational quotes and real-time clocks further reinforce mindfulness during study or work sessions. The interface in-
cludes clearly styled start and reset buttons, and the background themes automatically transition when the current audio ends. This project is ideal for users seeking a focused,
aesthetically pleasing productivity tool and offers flexibility for developers to customize positioning or themes as needed.
